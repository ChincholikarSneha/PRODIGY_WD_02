In this project, I have created a stopwatch aweb application using HTML, CSS, JS where html is used to structure the code and css is used in styling the application. 
Javascript is used for writing the main logic for user interactivity. 
In this project, by implementing functions for starting,pausing and resetting the stopwatch as well as displaying the lap times, users can measure and record time intervals.
All these functionalities is written in script.js
